## 🎓 Capstone Project

### 📌 Project Title:
**Medical Abbreviation Expansion in Handwritten Text**

- **Status:** Selected ✅  
- **GitHub Repo:** [https://github.com/rayanakarthikeyan/med-abbreviation-expander ]

---

### 📝 Project Description:

In the healthcare industry, medical notes often contain abbreviations like "b.i.d." (twice daily) or "p.o." (by mouth) written in handwritten prescriptions or reports. These can be confusing for patients and sometimes even for healthcare workers, leading to errors in treatment.

This project aims to automatically detect and expand medical abbreviations from handwritten text images using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and a domain-specific medical lexicon.

Users can simply upload a handwritten note or prescription photo, and the system will:

- Extract the relevant text using OCR  
- Identify standard medical abbreviations  
- Replace them with their full meanings in plain English  

This is a mobile-friendly app built using **Gradio + EasyOCR**, designed for instant results.

---

### 🎯 Key Features:

- 🔍 Detects medical abbreviations from real handwritten images  
- 📖 Expands each abbreviation using a curated medical dictionary  
- 🧼 Ignores unrelated words and UI noise from screenshots or cluttered notes  
- 💡 Works fully on phones via Hugging Face Spaces  
- 🖼️ No laptop or external software needed — just upload and expand!

---

### 🛠️ Tech Stack:

- Python  
- Gradio (for web interface)  
- EasyOCR (for handwritten text recognition)  
- Hugging Face Spaces (for deployment)  
- Custom Abbreviation Lexicon (in JSON)

---

### ✅ Use Cases:

- Doctors digitizing handwritten notes  
- Pharmacists reviewing prescriptions  
- Patients trying to understand medical instructions  
- Medical AI apps or tools needing abbreviation expansion
